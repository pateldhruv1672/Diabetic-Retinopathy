Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused due to Diabetes Mellitus in the diabetic
patients. It is the major cause of blindness for several people. The longer the diabetic
retinopathy affected the high chance that the person can go blind. 90% of cases reported
that the cause of blindness due to the diabetic retinopathy occur due to the lack of
proper treatment and monitoring the retinopathy before severe stage. Microaneurysms
formation and macular edema in the retina is the initial sign of DR and diagnosis at
the right time can reduce the risk of non proliferated diabetic retinopathy. The doctors
canâ€™t find a cure to the severe stage of diabetic retinopathy but can be detected in early
stage and prevent it. Hence automated computer diagnosis will help doctors in finding
Diabetic Retinopathy at early stage with less cost and time. Therefore we need a simple,
reliable and accurate model to automate this process.



In this project we used a modification of the U-Net architecture by introducing an
attention block to achieve accurate blood vessel segmentation on 40 fundus images from
DRIVE dataset including 7 abnormal pathology cases. The proper analysis of retinal
vessels is required to get the precise result, which can be done by Retinal Segmentation
which is the process of automatic detection of boundaries of blood vessels. We have
also used a CNN classifier to identify the stage of Diabetic Retinopathy
